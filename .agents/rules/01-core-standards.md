# VK.Blocks: Core Standards (Foundational Development)

### Rule 1 — Result Pattern

- Application Layer: RETURN `Result<T>` only. NEVER return null.
- For void operations, use `Result` (non-generic) or `Result<Unit>`. NEVER return bare `void` or `Task` from Application Layer handlers.
- NEVER use `Result.Failure("raw string")`. ALWAYS use predefined `Error` constants.
- Infrastructure Layer: exceptions ARE allowed, but MUST be caught at the boundary and mapped to `Result<T>`.
- Follow RFC 7807 for HTTP error responses.
- NEVER throw exceptions across layer boundaries.
  Exceptions MUST be caught and mapped to Result<T> at the Infrastructure boundary.
- Result<T> MUST carry structured Error objects, never raw strings or Exception objects.

### Rule 2 — Layer Dependencies

- Core/Application Layer: NO direct dependency on infrastructure libraries (EF Core / Redis / Azure SDK).
- MediatR is allowed as the ONLY orchestration mechanism in the Application Layer.
- All infrastructure concerns (DB / Cache / Messaging) MUST be abstracted behind interfaces.

### Rule 3 — Async

- Use `async/await` + `CancellationToken` for ALL I/O operations.
- NO `.Result`, `.Wait()`, or blocking calls.
- Prefer `ValueTask<T>` over `Task<T>` for interfaces and hot-path methods where synchronous completion is the common case (cache hits, in-memory checks). Avoid `ValueTask` when the operation is always async or may be awaited multiple times.
- ALL `await` calls within BuildingBlock/library code MUST use `.ConfigureAwait(false)` to prevent synchronization-context deadlocks.

### Rule 4 — Performance

- NO database queries inside loops.
- `.AsNoTracking()` is DEFAULT for all read queries.
- Batch operations MUST use `ExecuteUpdateAsync` / `ExecuteDeleteAsync` where applicable.
- NEVER use `ToListAsync()` without explicit pagination (`Take`/`Skip`) on unbounded queries.
- Prefer projection (`Select`) over full entity materialization for read-only queries.
- Prefer `ReadOnlySpan<T>` / `Span<T>` for string parsing and manipulation to avoid heap allocations.
- Only use `stackalloc` for constant or provably small sizes (≤ 256 bytes) to prevent stack overflow risks.
- Prefer `ArrayPool<T>.Shared` for large temporary buffers (> 256 bytes) to reduce GC pressure and avoid LOH allocations. ALWAYS return the array in a `finally` block.

### Rule 5 — Automation

- `IAuditable` fields (CreatedAt / UpdatedAt / CreatedBy) MUST be handled via DbContext Interceptors.
- `ISoftDelete` MUST be handled via DbContext Interceptors + Global Query Filters.
- NO manual audit or soft-delete logic in application code.
